Follow this guide if you would like to setup the project locally to contribute.

## Prerequisites

<ArticleTabs label1="Linux and MacOS" label2="Windows (WSL)">
<ArticleTab>

Before you can install and use Twenty, make sure you install the following on your computer:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node v18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
- [yarn v4](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)

<ArticleWarning>
`npm` won't work, you should use `yarn` instead. Yarn is now shipped with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.
You only have to run `corepack enable` to enable Yarn if you haven't done it yet.
</ArticleWarning>

1. Install WSL
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run: 
```powershell
wsl --install
```
You should now see a prompt to restart your computer. If not, restart it manually.

Upon restart, a powershell window will open and install Ubuntu. This may take up some time.
You'll see a prompt to create a username and password for your Ubuntu installation.

2. Install and configure git

```bash
sudo apt-get install git

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```

3. Install Node.js, nvm, yarn
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash

corepack enable
```
Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm.

## Step 1: Git Clone

In your terminal, run the following command. 


<ArticleTabs label1="SSH (Recommended)" label2="HTTPS">
<ArticleTab>
If you haven't already set up SSH keys, you can learn how to do so [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh). 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:twentyhq/twenty.git
```
</ArticleTab>
<ArticleTab>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty.git
```

</ArticleTab>
</ArticleTabs>

## Step 2: Position yourself at the root

```bash
cd twenty
```

You should run all commands in the following steps from the root of the project.

## Step 3: Set up a PostgreSQL Database
We rely on [pg_graphql](https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql) and recommend you use the scripts below to provision a database with the right extensions.  
You can access the database at [localhost:5432](localhost:5432), with user `twenty` and password `twenty` .

<ArticleTabs label1="Linux" label2="Mac OS" label3="Windows (WSL)">
  <ArticleTab>
    <b>Option 1:</b> To provision your database locally:
    ```bash
    make postgres-on-linux
    ```

    <b>Option 2:</b> If you have docker installed:
    ```bash
    make postgres-on-docker
    ```
  </ArticleTab>
  <ArticleTab>
    <b>Option 1:</b> To provision your database locally with `brew`:
    ```bash
    make postgres-on-macos-intel #for intel architecture

    make postgres-on-macos-arm #for M1/M2/M3 architecture
    ```

    <b>Option 2:</b> If you have docker installed:
    ```bash
    make postgres-on-docker
    ```
  </ArticleTab>
  <ArticleTab>
    <b>Option 1 :</b> To provision your database locally:
    ```bash
    make postgres-on-linux
    ```

    Note: you might need to run `sudo apt-get install build-essential` before running the above command if you don't have the build tools installed.

    <b>Option 2:</b> If you have docker installed:  
    Running Docker on WSL adds an extra layer of complexity.
    Only use this option if you are comfortable with the extra steps involved, including turning on [Docker Desktop WSL2](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl).
    ```bash
    make postgres-on-docker
    ```

## Step 4: Setup environment variables

Use environment variables or `.env` files to configure your project.

Copy the `.env.example` files in `/front` and `/server`:
```bash
cp ./packages/twenty-front/.env.example ./packages/twenty-front/.env

cp ./packages/twenty-server/.env.example ./packages/twenty-server/.env
```

## Step 5: Installing dependencies

<ArticleWarning>

Use `nvm` to install the correct `node` version. The `.nvmrc` ensures all contributors use the same version.

</ArticleWarning>

To build Twenty server and seed some data into your database, run the following commands:
```bash
nvm install # installs recommended node version

nvm use # use recommended node version

yarn
```

## Step 6: Running the project

Setup your database with the following command:
```bash
npx nx database:reset twenty-server
```

Start the server and the frontend:
```bash
npx nx start twenty-server

npx nx start twenty-front
```

Alternatively, you can start both applications at once:
```bash
npx nx start
```

Twenty's server will be up and running at [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql).
Twenty's frontend will be running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). Just login using the seeded demo account: `tim@apple.dev` (password: `Applecar2025`) to start using Twenty.


## Troubleshooting

#### CR line breaks found [Windows]

This is due to the line break characters of Windows and the git configuration. Try running:

```
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

Then delete the repository and clone it again.

#### Missing metadata schema

During Twenty installation, you need to provision your postgres database with the right schemas, extensions, and users.
If you're successful in running this provisioning, you should have `default` and `metadata` schemas in your database.
If you don't, make sure you don't have more than one postgres instance running on your computer.

#### Cannot find module 'twenty-emails' or its corresponding type declarations.

You have to build the package `twenty-emails` before running the initialization of the database with `npx nx run twenty-emails:build`

#### Missing twenty-x package

Make sure to run yarn in the root directory and then run `npx nx server:dev twenty-server`. If this still doesn't work try building the missing package manually.

#### Lint on Save not working

This should work out of the box with the eslint extension installed. If this doens't work try adding this to your vscode setting (on the dev container scope):

```
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {

  "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"

}
```

#### Docker container build

To successfully build Docker images, ensure that your system has a minimum of 2GB of memory available. For users of Docker Desktop, please verify that you've allocated sufficient resources to Docker within the application's settings.
