## Architecture

### Routing

[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) handles the routing. 

To avoid unnecessary [re-renders](/contributor/frontend/best-practices#managing-re-renders) all the routing logic is in a `useEffect` in `PageChangeEffect`.

### State Management

[Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/core-concepts) handles state management.

See [best practices](/contributor/frontend/best-practices#state-management) for more information on state management.

## Testing

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) serves as the tool for unit testing while [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is for component testing.

Jest is mainly for testing utility functions, and not components themselves.

Storybook is for testing the behavior of isolated components, as well as displaying the design system.
